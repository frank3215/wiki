Weekly reading assignments will be limited to small amounts of text, usually less than ten pages; additional literature and other media recommended by the teachers will be strictly optional. All students will receive extensive guidance on essay writing before they are given a choice of questions for the 500-word essay assignment in the second half of the semester. Students may take the course for either two or three credits. A third credit can be earned by attending weekly discussion sections in addition to the lectures; each section will be led by one of the teaching assistants, and individual groups will normally consist of no more than eight students.
（Writing advice for the 500-word essay
[This advice mainly concerns essays in philosophy, but much of it applies equally to the writing of other kinds of text.]
It is essential that your essay presents an argument in support of an answer to the question it addresses, and that this argument is then briefly defended against one or more possible objections.
Clarity and precision are ideals generally worth striving for. Here ‘clarity’ means that any intelligent person who has never before heard about the issues you are addressing can understand your essay. And ‘precision’ means that no advanced philosopher can reasonably complain that the terms of your argument are vague or not well defined.
Some useful principles that may be derived from these ideals are to:
first, restrict the scope of your essay to offering just an interesting part or version of an answer to merely an interesting part or version of the question (trying to offer a comprehensive philosophical treatment of anything in a short essay would usually be a hopeless undertaking);
second, reduce the number of specialist terms to a minimum (because each one requires an explanation when it is first introduced);
third, prioritise rigour—technical repetition, schematism etc.—over beauty (for example, continue to use the same word rather than varying it for purely aesthetic reasons); and
fourth, give many examples (any claim that is not absolutely obvious should ideally be accompanied by an example, but you do not have a sufficient number of words available, so choose your examples wisely).
Improving one’s philosophical writing takes time and effort. It is generally advisable to finish a first draft early, and revise it later with at least a few days in between.
Please feel free to approach the teachers with any writing-related questions anytime. You may also benefit from reading Michael Huemer’s writing guide (https://www.owl232.net/writing.htm).）
Weekly reading assignments, usually less than ten pages
Attendance (no more than three unexcused absences)
In addition, for a total of two credits
1 × 500-word essay, after Week 8 (50% of the overall course mark)
1 × two-hour written examination, at the end of term (50%)

Plagiarism
Students must not present someone else’s work or ideas as their own by incorporating it into their course work without full acknowledgement. Students found in violation of this rule will fail the course. If in doubt, please consult the university’s guidelines on plagiarism.</code></pre></div>
